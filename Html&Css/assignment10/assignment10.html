    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the fundamental language used to structure web pages. It defines elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML relies on **tags** to format content, with elements enclosed in opening and closing tags. It is often used alongside **CSS** for styling and **JavaScript** for interactivity, making it the backbone of web development.

    HTML is a simple yet powerful language that forms the foundation of web development. It allows developers to create structured content using a system of nested elements. Each element serves a specific purpose, such as defining text, embedding media, or linking different web pages. With the help of attributes, HTML elements can be customized to enhance functionality and accessibility.

    Despite being static on its own, HTML becomes dynamic when combined with CSS and JavaScript. CSS enhances the visual appeal by controlling layout, colors, and fonts, while JavaScript enables interactive features like animations and form validation. Together, these technologies create engaging and responsive websites that adapt to various devices and user needs.
